6. Validate the synomyns published to the target index's schema with the following link (do not forget to put your target index name) 

Example url: https://localhost:8985/solr/sc.hackaton_sxa_master_index/schema/analysis/synonyms/english

 ![synonyms schema](/docs/images/synonyms-solr.jpg)

7. Go to the site and try to search with added synonyms
